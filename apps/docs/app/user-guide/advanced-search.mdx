## Troubleshooting Search Issues

### No Results Found

> **💡 Try These Solutions:**
> 1. Check for typos in your search terms
> 2. Remove filters that might be too restrictive
> 3. Use broader, more general terms
> 4. Verify you have access to the content you're searching for
> 5. Check if the content has been recently added and needs time to index

### Too Many Results

> **📊 Narrow Your Search:**
> 1. Add more specific terms to your query
> 2. Use date filters to limit time ranges
> 3. Filter by file type or source application
> 4. Use exact phrase searches with quotes
> 5. Add negative terms to exclude irrelevant content

### Unexpected Results

> **⚠️ Debugging Steps:**
> 1. Review your search operators for syntax errors
> 2. Check Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT precedence)
> 3. Verify date format in date filters
> 4. Ensure field names are spelled correctly
> 5. Try breaking complex queries into simpler parts
